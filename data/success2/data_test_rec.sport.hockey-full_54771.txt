Subject: Wash/Isl OT game


	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio
for ESPN hockey.

	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game 
(even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game 
going to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said
he heard many people say f**K .!#$%.  
	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT
broadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so 
baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.

	GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT!!!
There have been to many f****n complainers about this game that it's making me
sick.
