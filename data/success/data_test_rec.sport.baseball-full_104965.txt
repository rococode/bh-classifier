Subject: bosio's no-hitter

I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at
work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he
wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles
by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And
if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an
error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced
past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether
Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.
