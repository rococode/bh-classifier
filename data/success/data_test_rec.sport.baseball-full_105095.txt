Subject: The Babe v. The Pride of the Yankees


The Babe and The Pride of the Yankees offer very different renditions of
the sotry about Ruth and Gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the
hospital.  Can some historian out there explain "history's" version of the
story.  

I wouldn't put is past either (or both) of the movies to season the truth
with a little extra spice.

Any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies?
