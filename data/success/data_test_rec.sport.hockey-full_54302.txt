Subject: Re: Radio stations


Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't
pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt
station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England
states.

This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an
all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy
being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there
is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened
28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially
troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay
tuned.
