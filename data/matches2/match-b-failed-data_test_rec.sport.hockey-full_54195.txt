Subject: Re: Ulf and all...

You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays
the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists
through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.
Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been
out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed
and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players
like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed
to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000
aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get
a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.
The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a
Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers
in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not
even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.
