And won't they have to change their name to the "Steelers" or something.
The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by

Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about
it, what lakes are in L.A.) then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers.
