Subject: They're real and they're spectacular

"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in
consecutive playoff games. 

If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice
in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that."

Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have
been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could
play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal."

"It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and
the wild crowd at the Arena.

It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks.

The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues
checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well.

The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach".
The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan
to Minsk"

Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.

Just a little fun.
