What really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth
between baseball and hockey after they stated that they couldn't show
the overtime period. I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey.
Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period 
ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey
something like 30 minutes later. Are they trying to alienate both
hockey and baseball viewers at the same time. As for Martinsville,
I wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was
no secret that it coincided with the draft. Why not let TNN broadcast
it ?
