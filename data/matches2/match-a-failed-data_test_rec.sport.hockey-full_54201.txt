I too am of the same  sentiment Bart, but realistically, this town DOESN'T WANT TO pay for 
quality player and hence we are loosing these people left, right and center.
Labour is also responsible for their boycott Pocklington movement.
I would like the Oilers to stay, but realistically, given this situation, it's 
bye-bye Oilers.
