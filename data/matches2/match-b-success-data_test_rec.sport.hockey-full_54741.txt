Subject: Re: Leafs: What happened?

Hi guys....

What happened?
	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by.
	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.
	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs
		the emotional edge.
	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.

	A couple of comments:

	1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three
	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted
	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth
	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for
	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the
	regular season.

	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this
	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is
	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the
	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever
	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).

	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better
	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better
	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the
	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm
	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D

	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not
		playing aggressive hockey....
	By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.
		I just like watching a good matchup.


	tee hee hee...ooops!
