 GR> -- Vancouver for the cup (in a virtual reality)--



            I am sorry to tell you this Greg, but in all
            reality, we cannot see Vancouver winning the
            cup.  They have a rrally good chance to come
            out of the Smythe Division, and a chance to make 
            it to the finals, but no one is capable this year
            of beating the Penguins, they have too many
            scoring threats. I would love to be proven wrong, but
            I must conclude that the Pens will win cup 3 this year.
