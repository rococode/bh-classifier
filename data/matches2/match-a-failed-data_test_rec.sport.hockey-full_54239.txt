This would be dumb move of the nineties...Lindros is big and strong...
but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the
other to drag along.

Not if Pocklington gets there first! (-...actually, if Pocklington
doesn't get a better deal, he would probably go to Hamilton...taking
the team out of Canada would get the whole country mad at him...
taking the team to Hamilton wouldn't get anybody mad at him that 
isn't mad at him already...and would make him a lot of friends
in Southern Ontario...so many that the whining of the stupid politicians in
Edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldn't be noticed at all.
Edmonton would wallow in anonymnity.
