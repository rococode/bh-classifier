And you can bet that I wouldn't be the only one not belonging to the
moderated group if it was moderated by an anally-retentive little
dullard like yourself.

I hardly need you to presume to lecture me on how to communicate my points
of view.  This "posting" that you have made is the second on the subject of
the NHL letter and you have yet to communicate your opinion on the matter.
Instead you content yourself with flaming me.

Result:
Moronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage of a perceived
opportunity to post rules for others to live by.
