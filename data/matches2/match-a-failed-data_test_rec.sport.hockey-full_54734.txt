Subject: Re: Where's Roger?

Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  I had him in
my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a new
news reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone.  I must
admit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game
as long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs.
