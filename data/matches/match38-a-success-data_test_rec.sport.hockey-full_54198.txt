Not necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely
needs to be taken in the proper perspective. A shining example is
if you look at the Penguins individual +/-, you will find very few minuses.
That only makes common sense, since they didn't lose many games.

Unfortunately, you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to
really come up with a statistic which really shows a player's value.
Let's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it. (like I'm doing now,
