= # INTRO PAGE 

= ml models details box: delete

= Designed to explore how people understand machine learning models... You do not need to know anything about machine learning models to do this task.<br/>

= # NEW PAGE: practice

= first, we'll look at a practice email that will show you how the model will show its decisions to you. (and accept feedback from you)

= # buttons (dont fade out buttons that arent disabled)

= # emails

= take out the Message:

= fix alignment

= # test section

= Do you think the machine learning model would correctly predict whether ?
= popup text to ask what the user thinks is right: Let us know, do you think this email is about hockey or baseball? (has not sure)
= change this to be inline

= # practice

= fix resize window wrap on email text

= lower font size
