Subject: Rules on-line?

Well, I'm finally about to key in the official rules for the archives, but
before I do, I will ask again...

does anybody have the official MLB rules in electronic format?

Just trying to save myself a ton of work...no, they don't scan well because
of the ridiculous format they're printed in.

thanks

- Matt
