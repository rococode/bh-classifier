Subject: Some baseball trivia


Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team?
Who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers?
(Hint: Nolan Ryan isn't either)

What two pitchers have over 100 career saves for two different teams?

Who is the only player to hit 300 or more career home runs and steal 300 or 
more career bases for the same team?

No fair peeking at your baseball stats....
