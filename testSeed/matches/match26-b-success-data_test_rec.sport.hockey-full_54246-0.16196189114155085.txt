Buffalo fans:

Some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator Al" on ESPN, 
believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres 
are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well 
aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as 
the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are 
still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at 
Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is 
critical for Boston, not Buffalo.
