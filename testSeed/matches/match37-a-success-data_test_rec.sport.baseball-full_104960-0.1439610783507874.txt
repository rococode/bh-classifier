mlb.c is archived on the Internet Baseball Archive

anoymous ftp to eucalyptus.cc.swarthmore.edu (130.58.67.44)
you must use your full email / username id as a password

cd ./baseball/schedules

it's filed as mlb-schedule-program.c for clarity

schedules pre-generated for east-coast times are there as text files as
well, and a couple of teams' TV schedules -- please send me more TV info if
you have it on other teams.
