the best home run i have *ever* seen came off, believe it or not,
Roger Clemens (sorry, Val) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to
Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck, and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or
even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard,
some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster (over 100 feet above the
ground total!)

truly an amazing shot.
