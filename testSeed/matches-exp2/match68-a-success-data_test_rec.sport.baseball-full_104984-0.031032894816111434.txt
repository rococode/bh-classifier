   My schedule is flexible so any games are candidates
AC>(though I'd prefer to see Texas.)
   Hi Tony.I think that I might be able to help you out!The Rangers are
   here in Toronto Thursday July 8th through Sunday July 11th and
   tickets should not be hard to find if you order them far enough in
   advance.Although I don't have a ticket broker's telephone number off
   hand if you give me a couple of days I will be able to get a hold a=
   of a couple.The Blue Jays ticket info # is (416)341-1111 or if you
   want to order by credit card,call (416) 341-1234.If you let me
   know,when you want the tickets I can save you a possible long
   distance call.If all else fails I might be able to pull a few strings
   and get you a pair.Let me know whats happening.
