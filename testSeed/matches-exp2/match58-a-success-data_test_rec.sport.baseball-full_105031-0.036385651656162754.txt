You must have heard wrong.  His arm is still sore.  He hasn't gone on the DL,
but he may.  Managmenet is treating him as a day-to-day situation.  

His doctors thought that he was ready, and they had him throw in
Colorado, but his arm wasn't up to the strain.  He is throwing every day,
but he's just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet.

(This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday,
4/23)
