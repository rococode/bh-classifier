    ESPN never committed (and I never saw advertised) to a particular
Thursday game.  They had originally scheduled Bos-Buf, and that was
somehow leaked on this net, but to my knowledge ESPN never publicly
released a schedule until Monday when they announced Pitt-NJ Thursday
and Boston-Buffalo Saturday.
