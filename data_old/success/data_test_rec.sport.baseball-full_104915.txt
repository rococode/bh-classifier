I know.  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar
to Baerga must be a Jay-Lover and Indian-Hater.  Sorry, you got that
one wrong!  I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about
the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year
last year, so I have to pick him.

You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense.

That's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively.)
