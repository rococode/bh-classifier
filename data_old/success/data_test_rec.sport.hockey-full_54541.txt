Gaetz won't be back. There's been rumors he was officially released right at
the end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen
confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he
wasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him
to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this
spring, doesn't make sense.
