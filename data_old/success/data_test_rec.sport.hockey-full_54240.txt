According to "Quotations from Chairman Cherry", Don was playing in
Springfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other
player had his paid off, but not Don didn't want to.

Don called the other player a "teacher's Pet", and the other player
replied "Ah, that's just sour grapes".

Don't know how accurate that is, but that's what's printed.
