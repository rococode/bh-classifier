Subject: Royals final run total...


I've been saying this for quite some time, but being absent from the
net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit...

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule.  (p.s. any ideas what this is?)

They will fall easily short of 600 runs, that's for damn sure.  I can't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division (like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the trades/aquisitions he's made)

c-ya
