Yep.  And the Ks don't have to denote a slow game, either.  Last night,
Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down (14 Ks in 8 innings),
yet the first 7 1/2 innings of the game were quite brisk.

He also threw 119 pitches, leading me to believe it isn't just the
number of pitches that determines the length of a game, but the 
behavior *between* pitches.
