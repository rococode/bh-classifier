I was in fact going to suggest that Roger take his way of discussion over
to r.s.football.pro. There this kind of hormone-only reasoning is the
standard. Being he canadian, and hockey what it is, I would have suggested
that r.s.h would work too. It is important in a thread that everyone
involved use the same body part to produce a post (brain being the organ
of choice here).
