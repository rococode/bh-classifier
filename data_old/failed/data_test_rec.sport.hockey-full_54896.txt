    Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was
especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he
could be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively, they
really had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night.
Craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a
few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much
high-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the
Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to
make this a series.

    In short, it was a great start!
