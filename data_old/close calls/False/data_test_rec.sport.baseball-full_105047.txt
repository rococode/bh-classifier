Sounds like Darryl being Darryl, Tommy spending too much time on
Slim Fast and needs a pasta fix, and the media being their usual
"charming" selves.  Sounds like a New York-like story to me!!  :-)

I saw the replay and am wondering what the big deal is?  I didn't
realize the folks in LA were making a big to do about it.  I think
Stawberry, Lasorda and the various media types should sit and watch
the replay then apologize to the fan.

Darryl has not gotten off to a good start, he has to blame someone.

As long as the fan doesn't interfere with the play I see no problems.
