I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris. The stats show he
is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened
to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good
games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was 
constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)
and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in
his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would
leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win
games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).
