bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than
mattingly in the future, but that they'll be about the same now is a
defensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in
the game today.

>2.  Wade Boggs.

i'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a
pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992
boggs still isn't ALL that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the
yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.
however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.

>3.  Spike Owen.

you have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than
velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.
however, i do enjoy the fact that "spike" is not a nickname.
not that this helps the yankees.

>4.  Danny Tartabull.

i strongly disagree.  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of
tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.
