Subject: Greg Maddux Run Support

I know, you all were saying "Ha!  The Braves score a few runs for 
Maddux, that'll shut that guy up."

But no,  I think we'll just keep track a bit longer...

Last  outing: 5 runs.

Total to date:  8 runs, 4 games

Braves record in Maddux's starts:  2-2

See ya next time.

Dennis
