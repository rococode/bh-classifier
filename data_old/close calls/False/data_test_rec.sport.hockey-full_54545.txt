Subject: Playoff consecutive loss record?

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I
noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and
now 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is, if there even is one...

I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since
they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that
was)

Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :)

Mike, the insomniaced
