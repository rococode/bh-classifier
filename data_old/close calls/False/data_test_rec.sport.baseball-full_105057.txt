Subject: Todd Worrell Update

According to an article in the LA Times, Todd Worrell will not
be ready to come off the DL list Friday.  It sounds like
he has had another set back in his come back.  At present,
he has stopped throwing the ball.  Supposedly, he had
no velocity.  It doesn't sound like there is any particular
time table at this point for when he will be back.
