WHY!!! DC/Baltimore is one of the top media markets (=the only thing the NHL
seems to care about these days), they've been doing far better than the NBA
Bullets at the gate for the last five years. The team has been a perennial
contender and fan support has been good to excellent . . . Why should Pollin
move to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro
sports. I don't get it...
