Subject: Re: John Wetteland, Derek Lilliquist, info please.


With all the recent problems the Indians have been having
with their pitching staff I have heard numerous names
thrown around about who could solve their problem.

One name I have not heard is Mike Soper (RP).  As far as
I know, Soper has had pretty good minor league stats.
Why not give the kid a chance?  Anyone know anything about
this guy?
