ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
to be shown between plays.

The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,
other times you get burned.
