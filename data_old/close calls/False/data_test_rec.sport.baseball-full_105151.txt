I hear ya!  Then again, we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans, and
that the Cubs will eventually blow it.  After all, the Cubs are the easiest
team in the National League to root for.  No Pressure.  You know they will
lose eventually.  Oh well, I suppose we must have faith.  After all, they
do look pretty good, and they don't even have Sandberg back yet.  

CUBS IN '93!!!!!
