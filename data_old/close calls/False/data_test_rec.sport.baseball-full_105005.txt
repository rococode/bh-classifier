Did he ever really convert?  He married a Jewish woman, but I've never
heard him say he converted.  Elliot Maddox, on the other hand...

Yep, Holtzman.  Saul Rogovin won an ERA title in 1949 or so before blowing out
the arm.

I'd be surprised.  btw, they may just be shopping Gallego around to
make room for AS.
