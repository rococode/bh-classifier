   Good question!  I kind of wondered about this myself.  Just one
thought I had on it  -  the Babe himself was IN "Pride of the
Yankees", which made me think

a) that version may be closer to the truth, and 
b) the Babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even
though some of the scenes didn't make him look completely flattering.
