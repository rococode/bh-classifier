Okay, here's the down side of the ESPN deal: no additional coverage.
With a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers
like Canucks-Jets, Caps-whoever and Red Wings-Leafs (or whoever else
is playing).

For our area (Islanders-Devils), it's likely to be the Bruins, since
the other Adams series is Montreal-Quebec.  I'd prefer the latter
myself ...

I'm under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals,
but if St. Louis at Chicago pops up we'll know ...
