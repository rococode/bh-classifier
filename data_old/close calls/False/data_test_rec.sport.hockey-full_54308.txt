Wood is fairly small for an enforcer-type. I mean, Fleury does a pretty good
job and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. 

Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't
ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he
really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or
skate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,
but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing
before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a
fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything
he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach
until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth
talking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.

Unless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my "career minor
leaguer" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the
Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He
needs to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some
versatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't
particularly good as a goon.
