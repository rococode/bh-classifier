ESPN must have some very poor marketing people.  They are only concerned with
featuring players (i.e. Mario) than featuring good competitive hockey.

I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence
would prefer the Wales stuff.  Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.

In summary, if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage, 
watch CBC from Canada.  They may be biased toward Canadian teams, but they
don't treat the viewers like idiots, they provide nice updates, and Don Cherry
will always provide a few laughs.
