Wait a minute.  If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball 
over ANY portion of the plate.


Given that the ball is ~ 2.9 "" in diameter.  This sez that the zone width
is ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9)  or 22.8 "" . While this is still less than the 23 "
number given.  I can forgive any UMP for misjudging .2" on an object moving
at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.

I think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules!!!
