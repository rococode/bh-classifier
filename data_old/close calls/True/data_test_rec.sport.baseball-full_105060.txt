Actually, I was hoping for Barry Bonds.  Oh well.

First off, Jeff has had like 5 hits in the last two games, and walked
*yet again*.  Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which
means his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up.  If
that increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third
baseman in 1993.  Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk,
and clearly isn't a .320 hitter.  My bet is that he won't be getting
any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the "Lind Shift"
we were seeing in the NL.

>Any predictions as to when he is sent to Buffalo or released outright?

No, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really
surprise me.  Jeff King is currently in the top 10 in the league in
*walks*.  Something is up...
