You wouldn't have to put my name at the bottom if you simply appended a 
standard disclaimer that the opinions expressed in your petition in no
way claim to represent the views of either rec.sport.hockey or the internet
as a whole.  You have surely seen these disclaimers appended to the postings
of many who work for companies and post on the net.  The disclaimers, clever
though some of them may be, are there for a reason.
