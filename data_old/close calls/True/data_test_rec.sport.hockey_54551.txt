Subject: Re: BUFFALO 4, Boston 0: Defense!!

I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright
spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience.
What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie
game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the
puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that
kind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that
is for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston
(except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad
,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the
puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.  There game plan is
sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo.....

               IMHO
