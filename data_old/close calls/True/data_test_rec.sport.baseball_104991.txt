In this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), Vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out Riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable.  Seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it
work so he's entitled.
