I don't "notice" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and
yes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I've seen
so far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game).

What's the scoop on this guy? Is he the latest incarnation of
KERRY FRASER??? Just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesn't
make you a good ref!!! Making the right call does...

My votes for:
Best Ref: Van Hellemond
Most Improved: Koharski
Worst: Paul Stewart

(Oops, I don't really want to start a best/worst ref thread so don't
follow up ;-)
