Subject: switzerland at WC93

what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final
and now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !!
after the 0:1 against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were
overrun 0:6 by the russian team.
now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the
B-level. does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for
the olympic games '94 in Lillehammer or are some teams already
qualified for them.

hopp schwiiz
