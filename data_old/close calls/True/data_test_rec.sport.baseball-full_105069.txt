---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or
beyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game.
	For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is
pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,
there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game
with a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the
game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save
and Clemens would get the win.                     
                                                Thats how I beleive it works.
