Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle.  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
1992.  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL.

However, I was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially in
the third round.  He certainly didn't look like NHL material...
