	Yeah, maybe that is more likely.  But from the Mariners-Tigers 
series, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers 
seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  The 
funny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the
four game series if I remember correctly.
