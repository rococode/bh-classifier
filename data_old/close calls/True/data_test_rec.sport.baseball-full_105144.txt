Subject: Re: The 1964 Phillies: deja vu?

My dad has always blamed the Phillies collapse in '64 on me...  On Sept 21,  1964,  the Phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play.  I was born on Sept 21,  1964.  The Phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the Cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  To this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when I was born!
