Subject: John Wetteland, Derek Lilliquist, info please.



Hi there,

      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again
      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports 
      section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was
      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. 

      Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now
      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to 
      replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on
      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your
      time. 


      Ryan Robin.
