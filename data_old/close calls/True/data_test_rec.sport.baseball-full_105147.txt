Interesting article, Craig.  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball
teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century 
attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the
owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary
to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't
realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game
and its fans.
