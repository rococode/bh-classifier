Attention Penguins fans once again, apparently 99.999% of you understand that
this was just a joke (Hence the :-) next to it) but one idiot on here doesn't
as he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e-mails telling me that this is
wrong.  I have no intentions of sending e-mail to anyone should the Pens win
tonight, and I really do not expect/do not intend to lead any of you to send
this poster e-mail either.  It was NOT a serious request.  If you didn't know
that (which you probably did) then don't do it.  Thanks.
