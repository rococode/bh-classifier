	I agree.  However, I have to object.  Growing up in the early
1980's and playing 2 years of Mario Mendoza-esque Little League, I was
told that since my hitting, well, sucked, I would do best to either
"Walk, or take one in the face for the team".  I did both.  And, my
Yankee fan father would say, "Bat like Oscar Gamble".  So I did.  And my
career OBP was about .550.
	Not only was Oscar a fun guy to watch, but he had some pretty 
cool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league
players in history.
