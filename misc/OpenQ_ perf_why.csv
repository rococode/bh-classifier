WILL_NOT_LEARN,x,It mostly did really well.  There were only about two or three that were questionable.,6,26700

WILL_LEARN,"MARGINAL_FEEDBACK, HIGH_QUAL","The model predicted most of the emails correctly already.

WILL_LEARN,"MARGINAL_FEEDBACK, HIGH_QUAL","It only got one or two wrong, so I don't think it has enough info to really change how it decides. It'd need more than 2 samples.",4,54755

WILL_LEARN,FEEDBACK,BECAUSE I TAUGHT IT A FEW OF ITS ERRORS,6,67356
WILL_LEARN,FEEDBACK,I think it would do slightly better because my feedback will improve the decisions it makes.,5,40337
x,NEEDS_FEEDBACK,"I feel like a lot of the words that the model chose as the most important didn't have anything to do with either sport. It was almost random whether the model was correct or not. Some of the highlighted words were sport related, but more fo them were not.",4,33869
WILL_NOT_LEARN,x,"I have no reason to believe the model will work any differently than it did on the first e-mails, so it should be about the same.  It probably consistently uses the same method to determine each e-mail, so it should deliver the same quality of results.",4,20030

x,x,seems right,5,37429
WILL_LEARN,MARGINAL_FEEDBACK,I mostly just told it it was right which can't be too helpful to get better. I don't know how I could have made it much better.,4,89443
WILL_LEARN,FEEDBACK,Because I gave feedback when it was wrong and selected specific words to differentiate between hockey and baseball.,5,83453
COND_LEARN,"HIGH_QUAL, MODEL_ADAPTS/FEEDBACK, TRICKY_INPUT","Because I think that some emails are ambiguous. Maybe with learning some of the teams and the slang for them, it might get better but not by much. I think we were at 70-80% on the last round so probably in the 80% range would be realistic.",5,37495

WILL_LEARN,"HIGH_QUAL, FEEDBACK",I feel that the model should be able to improve due to the high level of reliability the model has shown so far which makes me mostly trust the efficiency of the model. Additionally my inputs in the second phase is likely to have positive influences on how the model makes its decision.,6,56788
WILL_LEARN,NEEDS_FEEDBACK,"It hasn't seemed to learn very much. It bases its decisions on words that could be related to either baseball or hockey.
